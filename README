KeyListen daemon

Prototype for Ubuntu Touch to listen for keys and start Ubuntu Touch apps.
This was made for the Volla Phone, where the fingerprint sensor emits key events for various actions.

How to build:
make CC=/path/to/crosscompiler

To install:
Copy the built binary to /home/phablet/ and keylistend.conf to /home/phablet/.config/upstart/, then reboot. Make sure to activate the FingerPrint HAL by doing anything which uses it. Example: go to Settings, Security, Fingerprint, Add new and tap until ~10%. Now go back to the home screen. From this point, tapping on the sensor should open the dialer app. To customize this, checkout the keylistend.conf and keylistend --help
