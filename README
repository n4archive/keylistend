KeyListen daemon

Prototype for Ubuntu Touch to listen for keys and start Ubuntu Touch apps.
This was made for the Volla Phone, where the fingerprint sensor emits key events for various actions.

How to build:
make 
To crosscompile:
make CC=/path/to/crosscompiler
You can also set optional flags like SCANEVENT or NOUT like this:
make CFLAGS="-DNOUT -DSCANEVENT"
(SCANEVENT shows all events happening on that device, NOUT will run shellscripts instead of UT apps)

To install:
Copy the built binary to /home/phablet/ and keylistend.conf to /home/phablet/.config/upstart/, then reboot. Make sure to activate the FingerPrint HAL by doing anything which uses it like unlocking your device with it (this is an fingerprint HAL limitation). You can also activate it by going to Settings, Security, Fingerprint, Add new and tap until ~10%. Now go back to the home screen. From this point, tapping on the sensor should open the dialer app. To customize this, checkout the keylistend.conf and keylistend --help
